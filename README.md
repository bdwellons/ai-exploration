## AI Exploration and tangible examples

I'm playing with a number of AI concepts and frameworks. The goal of this repo is to catalog working examples. Each example resides in its own folder and has an accompanying README.md. It will describe the basics of the example and any quick start details necessary to get it rolling.


### Examples In Repo:
- [Strands Agent with local MCP server providing math functions and connectivity to Bedrock for division/quotients](./strands-with-mcp/README.md)
